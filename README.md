# Automated Animations
## Note that since I've taken over the module, there will be no updates or fixes to the V12 version, as v13 is close i will start developement with that foundry version.
This module will automatically run most JB2A Animations such as Melee/Ranged Attacks, Spell Attacks, and Instant Spells

**No animations are provided in this module. It is designed to work in conjunction with the JB2A Animated Assets module. This module has been reviewed, approved and recommended by JB2A**  
I am not affiliated with JB2A, and am working on this only as a side project to make these great animation more easily accesible.
